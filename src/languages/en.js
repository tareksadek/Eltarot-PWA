        + '&nbsp;It appears that divination with playing cards started to become popular in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century,'
        + '&nbsp;although at that time, it was far more simple than the way we use Tarot today.'

        + 'By the eighteenth century, however, people were beginning to assign specific meanings to each card, and even offer suggestions as to how they could be laid out for divinatory purposes.',

        title: 'Ancient Egypt',
        paragraph: 'A complex published by Antoine Court de Gebelin revealed that the symbolism in the Tarot was in fact derived from the esoteric secrets of Egyptian priests.'
        + '&nbsp;De Gebelin went on to explain that this ancient occult knowledge had been carried to Rome and revealed to the Catholic Church and the popes,'
        + 'who desperately wanted to keep this arcane knowledge secret.'
        + '<br />'
        + 'In his essay, the chapter on Tarot meanings explains the detailed symbolism of Tarot artwork and connects it to the legends of Isis, Osiris and other Egyptian gods.'

        + '&nbsp;Artists in Europe created the first playing cards, which were used for games, and featured four different suits.'
        + 'These suits were similar to what we still use today – staves or wands, discs or coins, cups, and swords.'

        + '<br />'
        + 'At Waite&apos;s suggestion, Smith used the Sola Busca artwork for inspiration, and there are many similarities in the'
        + 'symbolism between Sola Busca and Smith&apos;s final result. Smith was the first artist to use characters as representative images in the lower cards.'
